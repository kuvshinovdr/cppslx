# cppslx

Some utilities extending C++23 standard library.

## Introduction

The CppSLX (standing for C++ Standard Library eXtensions) is a collection of C++ definitions that cover some C++ std library shortcomings (as I perceive them, of course).

## Prerequisites

ISO C++20/23-compliant compiler. Modules are not used.

## Building/installing

Header-only library. Just copy it where you want it to reside.
